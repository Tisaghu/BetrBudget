# Description

As college students start growing out of dependencies on their parents, one of the most important lessons to be taught is financial responsibility. There are many ways to keep track of a budget but it can be confusing to the point of deferring the user. With BetrBudget, a simple and valuable budgeting app, the user is opened up to the world of finances in the form of a simplistic design, without the intimidating features that most students wouldn't understand how to use anyways. Unlike other apps, curating to college students and younger audiences is something that is taken seriously. Not only is there a simpler easier to understand design, but also features that specifically curate towards people with lower incomes that typically live in roommate environments. By using BetrBudget, keeping financially organized without putting in lots of research and time into learning how to budget is possible and being newly independent is a lot easier.

Our app also will allow us to create groups where multiple registered users can track shared expenses together. This will mostly be intended for shared periodic expenses between the members of the group, such as rent or a shared subscription service. Each group member will have their own permissions level (admin, edit, view) which can be set by the group owner (or those with 'admin' permissions). Admin will also allow you to kick/add members to the group at any time. Edit will allow the member to manage expenses for the group, but not manage the members. View will only allow the member to see and receive notifications from the shared budget. Notifications for expenses will be sent out to everyone in the group for the group expenses just like with any other periodic expense. Registered users have the ability to log income and keep track of the period, amount, and type with the option to change details as needed. Each registered user will have access to their own settings allowing them to view and change various options related to their in app experience, like notification choices and a view of their lifetime savings. Periodic Expenses are linked to different attributes that can change how their data is viewed. This is done with an enumerated period of time of either daily, weekly, monthly, and never.

# Sequence Diagram

Use Case: Log Expense
Pre-Condition: User has app installed, User has valid account
Post-Condition: Users expense is associated with their account and logged in DataStore
Basic Path:
1. User logs in to app
2. Server ensures valid login
3. User selects "Log Expense" option
4. App prompts user for expense details
5. User enters expense information
6. Expense data is transferred to DataStore by server
7. Users data is updated accordingly
8. Server informs user of successful expense log

Alternate Paths:
1. Users log in is invalid, step 2 fails 
2. User is shown invalid login message

1. Expense data is not updated, step 7 fails
2. Server informs user of failed expense log

Choose a design pattern from one of the categories: Structural or Creational.
Present a class diagram representing the design pattern chosen.

# Design Principles

Analyzing the current design, many changes need to be made to completely fulfill the SOLID principles. 
Through the SRP: The main class does most of the heavy lifting, although within that class many functions exist. Refactoring the functions to extend the main class using other classes will require some effort.
Through the OCP: As our interfaces and backend development are still in early programming, we will need to make modifications to many of the entities. The pie chart entity is one that is nearly set in stone. Refactoring it into its own class and having flexibility of reading data will need to be developed. 
Through the LSP: Without having developed subtypes in the application as of its current state, this will need to be monitored and adhered to as development progresses.
Through the ISP: In its current state, the separation of interfaces seems to be nearly fulfilled. As functions are added, the development team will continue to monitor and refactor the program to fulfill this principle. Ex. in its current functionality, the at-a-glance main page, the group screen, the expense page, the options screen, and the report screen are separated to give the user ease of access to each page with its own functionality.
Through the DIP: The development team will need to refactor many functions into separate classes that extend others. As development proceeds, the team will proceed with refactoring and continuing forward with this principle in mind.
